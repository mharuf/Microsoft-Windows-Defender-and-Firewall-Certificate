<h1>Microsoft Windows Defender and Firewall Certificate</h1>
Two important tools in cyber security are Microsoft Windows Defender and Microsoft Windows Firewall. I decided to take this course to develop my understanding of them and to practise using the software. I was given the opportunity to update and configure Windows Defender to scan for viruses in specific files. I then enabled and configured Windows Firewall to change rules for different connections to the domain, private and public networks. This project was very interesting as it gave me an insight into how antivirus scans can be conducted, as well as how firewalls can be used to block or change connection capabilities.
